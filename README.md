## Parsley

Parsley is a template parser for WO. It's based on WOOgnl and thus supports it's inline binding syntax. It's a pure WO project, meaning it does not require Project Wonder (although, of course, it works fine with Project Wonder as well).

## Why?

To get nice inline error messages when template parser errors occur (rather than huge stack-tracey exception pages). Currently, this only applies when you attempt to use an element/component that doesn't exist and for handling `UnknownKeyEception` (badly formed keypaths in bindings) and `WODynamicElementCreationException` which for well designed elements will cover things like wrong binding configuration.

_Actually_, this isn't the real "why" of the project. But it's currently the nicest byproduct visible to the user, making for a good cover story.

## Usage

### Development version

To use the development verison of the parser, clone this repo and import the project to your workspace or `mvn install` it.

Then add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>is.rebbi</groupId>
	<artifactId>parsley</artifactId>
	<version>1.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Latest release

Artifacts from are currently published on Github packages. Unfortunately, access to Github packages requires authentication, so to access the repository, you need to generate an access token for your github user. Once you've done that, add the following to the `repositories` section of your `pom.xml` or `~/.m2/settings.xml`, replacing `$github_username` and `$github_access_token` with their corresponding values:

```xml
<repository>
	<id>parsley</id>
	<name>Parsley Maven Repository</name>
	<url>https://$github_username:$github_access_token@maven.pkg.github.com/undur/Parsley</url>
	<releases>
		<enabled>true</enabled>
	</releases>
	<snapshots>
		<enabled>false</enabled>
	</snapshots>
</repository>
```

Then add this dependency to your pom.xml:

```xml
<dependency>
	<groupId>is.rebbi</groupId>
	<artifactId>parsley</artifactId>
	<version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

### Enabling Parsley in your project

â€¦and add this somewhere in your application's initialization, for example in the Application class constructor:

```java
public Application() {
	parsley.Parsley.register();
	parsley.Parsley.showInlineRenderingErrors( isDevelopmentModeSafe() ); // For enabling inline error reporting in dev mode
}
```

## Differences from WOOgnl

* We don't support OGNL expressions in binding paths. Support could be added as a plugin, but I'm not a fan of it myself so...
* We don't support WOOGnl's `parseStandardTags` behaviour. Might be looked into if anyone actually uses it, which I doubt.
* We don't support tag processors (WOOgnl's `<wo:not>` being an example use). Never used them but the idea isn't that bad. However functionality of that kind needs work in the parser so that's for later.
* For inline bindings, only exactly `$true` and `$false` will get interpreted as booleans.
